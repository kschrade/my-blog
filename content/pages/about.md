## Who am I?

My name is Kyle Schrade. I am a software engineer at StockX (more on that later) who has a passion for GraphQL, monorepos, physical activity, technology and interesting problems. I live with my fianc√©e Abbey (she will kill you if you forget the e) and cat sneaker. Abbey named the cat before she knew me which is extremely ironic with my current job.

## What do I do?

I work for a company called [StockX](https://stockx.com/) where I am an engineer on the "edge" team. Many companies spin up this team when they are trying to break down a monolith and we are the same. But we have morphed over the last year or so from our team of people watching over the gateway to a team eager to help people contribute to GraphQL at StockX. I created the POC of GraphQL at StockX and have helped quite a few people make additions to the graph. We have gone in less than a year from 0 rpm to close to 500k rpm all while keeping an availability of 99.9%.

I'm also the creator of a service that StockX will hopefully open source called Barricade. Which is a very simple yet extremely impactful service that scalesapplcations in kubernetes by changing values in an horizontal pod autoscaler (hpa). With the volatility of our traffic at StockX this has increased our availability at StockX by close to 90% at times.

## Before StockX

Before StockX I worked a ton of random jobs in construction and athletics. I played college baseball at Mott community college (more on that later) so I had many doors opened up for me that not everyone gets to walk though. But after my time chasing my dream of playing professional baseball, I started in tech. I got an internship at United Shore (mortgage company) and then got hired full time after my internship while I was still in college. While at United Shore I supported a business team, helped with an internal system overhaul, helped create some internal frameworks. During this time I was offered the job of Associate Architect, I ended up turning it down to go to StockX but that's a discussion for another day. I learned a lot there and look back at my time fondly as where I learned how to become an engineer.

## Before Tech/Other Fun Things About Me

Now the fun personal stuff! Before my time in tech I was fortunate enough to play baseball in college. It was at a Jr college, but I had some amazing players I played with and against. In my 2 years there we had 3 team mates of mine throw 90+ miles per hour and almost everyone go off to play at another university after their time there. In high school I ended up playing with almost exclusively division 1 and 2 baseball players and 2 of my teammates were drafted to MLB teams. Unfortunately I dislocated my shoulder 2 times in high school, the second time I ended up tearing a bunch of ligaments in my shoulder, and 2 more times in college. This cut my playing career short. I ended up making a decision to quit baseball after my 2 years at Mott and go to a university and get an education like everyone else. It seemed like the smart thing to do after all the shoulder problems, being at the will of my coach and being on the all academic team. So I transfered to Oakland University.
