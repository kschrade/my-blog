# What is GraphQL?

From the [GraphQL website](https://graphql.org/learn/):

> GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
